# AndroidMVP
This is a demo application to show different types of product tags in a listview. This Tags are expandable. Upon expanding particular Tag from list view it will redirect to the product page, which will show list of all products having a same Tag value.

This application is implemented using MVP architecture and used Retrofit, Picasso and gson for things like networking and rendering images.
